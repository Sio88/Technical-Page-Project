              <code>First Section paragraph</code>
              Christopher Columbus landed on Trinidad, which he named for the Holy Trinity, in 1498 and found a land quietly inhabited by the Arawak and Carib Indians. It was nearly a century later that Europeans began to settle Trinidad (called "leri&—land of the hummingbird—by the Amerindians). The Spanish settlement of San Jose de Oruma, located near the current city of Port of Spain, was the first of the island’s European villages, but was summarily invaded and destroyed by England's Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595. Trinidad remained under Spanish control until eventually seized by the British in 1797. As sugar plantations developed around the island, thousands of African slaves were brought to the island as laborers. When Britain abolished slavery, plantation owners looked to India, China, and the Middle East for laborers, bringing to Trinidad thousands more indentured workers.</p>
      
      <p>Tobago, seen more as a strategic possession than an island for settlement, was often a point of contention. Amerindian tribes battled over the island and later, England, France, Spain, Latvia and others fought to control Tobago—over the years, control of this small parcel of land shifted more than 30 times. In the late 1600s, settlers established successful sugar, cotton and indigo plantations, largely through slave labor imported from Africa. In 1781, the French invaded again, causing tremendous destruction around Tobago, which impacted the previously thriving local economy.

            A large number of cultures have influenced the evolution of the Trinidad and Tobago culture. The distinct cultures that have a major influence on the culture of Trinidad and Tobago are Indian, African, Portuguese, Amerindian, Spanish, Chinese, and others. The country's links with the United Kingdom have left a major impact on its culture, and English is widely spoken across the nation. There is also a distinct difference between the histories and culture of Trinidad and Tobago and regional differences in the country as well. Here we inspect some of the basic aspects associated with the culture of Trinidad and Tobago and social beliefs in the country.

               Situated off the northeast coast of South America at the extreme southern end of the Lesser Antilles, the islands of Trinidad and Tobago cover an area of 5,128 sq km (1,981 sq mi). Comparatively, the area occupied by Trinidad and Tobago is slightly smaller than the state of Delaware. Trinidad, the main island, rectangular in shape, has an area of 4,828 sq km (1,863 sq mi), extending 143 km (89 mi) N – S and 61 km (38 mi) E – W . Cigar-shaped Tobago, 31 km (19 mi) northeast of Trinidad, has an area of 300 sq km (116 sq mi), a length of 42 km (26 mi) NE – SW , and an average width of 12 km (7.5 mi) NW – SE . Sixteen small islands are found off the coasts. The Atlantic Ocean is to the E and the Caribbean Sea to the W . Venezuela lies only 11 km (7 mi) S w across the shallow Gulf of Paria.</p>
             
      <p>
      Trinidad and Tobago have a coastline length of 362 km (225 mi). The capital city of Trinidad and Tobago, Port-of-Spain, is located on Trinidad's Gulf of Paria coast.</p>

            The twin-island is famous for its rich melting-pot of cuisine, influenced by a multitude of cultures. Over the years, both the colonizers and slaves left their mark on the islands’ food. Hence, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago has a rare and exceptional diversity within their cuisine, making it unique in the Caribbean.</p>
            
      <p>
        However, the most popular dishes came from countries such as India, Africa, Syria, and Spain. The evidence is very apparent in the list below, with the curry from India, the Spanish influence in the Pastelles, and the dasheen from Africa. Nevertheless, fusing these influences and distinct flavors is what makes up the rest of the popular foods. These various mouthwatering dishes are always accessible and readily available, especially on the island of Trinidad.</p>

           <code>Fifth Section paragraph</code>
          Trinidad and Tobago Carnival – the greatest street parade in the world – originated during the period of slavery when the slaves, banned from attending their masters’ fancy balls and parties, would improvise by staging their own costumed event in their quarters. After Emancipation, these former slaves challenged the plantation owners to publicly host their own Carnival celebration.</p>
        <p>
          Since then, Carnival has evolved into an inclusive, elaborate billion-dollar revenue earner for Trinidad and Tobago. Like other Roman Catholic countries involved in Carnival, these celebrations take place on the Monday and Tuesday directly before Ash Wednesday, usually marked in February or March. Activities on the two days take the form of street parades by bands of costumed masqueraders</p>
      
        <p>
          A Carnival band could comprise as many as 3,000 masqueraders. To control this number of people on the streets, organisers would divide the band into sections of 200 to 500 masqueraders. Most Carnival bands are led by a King or Queen, some of whom had competed on Dimanche Gras (Carnival Sunday) in order to win the coveted title of King or Queen of Carnival.</p>
